# Docker Security Hardening Measures

This document outlines the security hardening measures implemented in the Dockerfile for the Markdown to EPUB converter application, as well as additional recommendations for further security improvements.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Multi-stage Build
- **What**: Used a multi-stage build process to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.
- **Why**: Reduces the final image size and attack surface by excluding build tools and intermediate files from the final image.

### 2. Non-root User
- **What**: Created a dedicated non-root user (`appuser`) and group (`appgroup`) to run the application.
- **Why**: Prevents privilege escalation attacks by not running processes as root within the container.

### 3. Minimal Base Image
- **What**: Used Alpine Linux as the base image.
- **Why**: Alpine has a smaller footprint, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.

### 4. Security Updates
- **What**: Added `apk upgrade --no-cache` to apply the latest security patches.
- **Why**: Ensures the container includes the latest security fixes for the base image packages.

### 5. Proper File Permissions
- **What**: Set appropriate ownership for application files using `--chown=appuser:appgroup`.
- **Why**: Follows the principle of least privilege by restricting file access to only what's necessary.

### 6. Secure Environment Variables
- **What**: Set Python-specific security environment variables.
- **Why**: Prevents Python from creating `.pyc` files, ensures unbuffered output, and disables pip version checks.

### 7. Health Checks
- **What**: Added Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction.
- **Why**: Enables Docker to monitor the application's health and restart it if necessary.

### 8. Resource Limits
- **What**: Documented recommended resource limits (memory, CPU).
- **Why**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks and ensures container stability.

### 9. Gunicorn Security Settings
- **What**: Configured Gunicorn with security-focused parameters.
- **Why**: Limits worker count, sets timeouts, and enables proper logging to detect and prevent attacks.

### 10. Cleanup
- **What**: Removed package caches and temporary files.
- **Why**: Reduces image size and removes potentially sensitive information.

## Critical Vulnerability Assessment

### Base Image
The Python 3.11 Alpine image is regularly updated, but you should:
- Regularly rebuild the image to incorporate the latest security patches
- Consider using image scanning tools like Trivy, Clair, or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities
- Pin the exact version of the base image (e.g., `python:3.11.4-alpine3.18`) for reproducibility

### Dependencies
1. **Flask**: Version 2.3.3 should be checked against the CVE database for known vulnerabilities
2. **Gunicorn**: Version 21.2.0 should be checked against the CVE database for known vulnerabilities
3. **Pandoc**: The version from Alpine repositories should be regularly updated

### Application Code
The application uses `subprocess.run()` to execute pandoc, which could potentially be vulnerable to command injection if user input is not properly sanitized. The current implementation appears to properly handle user input, but care should be taken when modifying the code.

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Implement Content Security Policy
Add appropriate headers to restrict what resources can be loaded by the application.

### 2. Enable Docker Security Options
When running the container, consider using:
```bash
docker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop=ALL --read-only ...
```

### 3. Use Docker Secrets
For sensitive information like API keys or credentials, use Docker secrets instead of environment variables.

### 4. Regular Security Scanning
Implement automated scanning of:
- Docker images (using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Docker Scout)
- Dependencies (using tools like Safety, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Application code (using SAST tools like Bandit for Python)

### 5. Image Signing
Implement Docker Content Trust to sign and verify images.

### 6. Network Security
- Use network segmentation
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Consider using an API gateway

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement centralized logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Monitor container resource usage

### 8. Update Dependencies Regularly
Regularly update all dependencies to include security patches.

### 9. Read-Only Filesystem
Mount the filesystem as read-only where possible, with specific write permissions only for necessary directories.

### 10. Input Validation
Ensure all user input is properly validated and sanitized before processing.

## Conclusion

The implemented security measures significantly improve the security posture of the Docker image. However, security is an ongoing process, and regular updates, scans, and reviews should be conducted to maintain a strong security posture.
