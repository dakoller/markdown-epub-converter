# Changes Made to Harden Docker Image and Fix Zero Byte Output Issue

This document summarizes all the changes made to improve the security of the Docker image and address the zero byte output issue in the Markdown to EPUB converter.

## Security Hardening Measures

### 1. Multi-stage Build
- Implemented a multi-stage build process to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies
- Reduced the final image size and attack surface by excluding build tools from the final image

### 2. Non-root User
- Created a dedicated non-root user (`appuser`) and group (`appgroup`) to run the application
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks by not running processes as root

### 3. Security Updates
- Added `apk upgrade --no-cache` to apply the latest security patches
- Ensures the container includes the latest security fixes

### 4. Proper File Permissions
- Set appropriate ownership for application files
- Created directories with proper permissions
- Follows the principle of least privilege

### 5. Secure Environment Variables
- Set Python-specific security environment variables
- Prevents Python from creating `.pyc` files and ensures unbuffered output

### 6. Health Checks
- Added Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction
- Enables Docker to monitor the application's health and restart it if necessary

### 7. Resource Limits
- Added resource limits in docker-compose.yml
- Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### 8. Gunicorn Security Settings
- Configured Gunicorn with security-focused parameters
- Limits worker count, sets timeouts, and enables proper logging

### 9. Cleanup
- Removed package caches and temporary files
- Reduces image size and removes potentially sensitive information

### 10. Security Labels
- Added metadata labels to the image for better tracking and identification

## EPUB File Integrity Fixes

### 1. Fixed Corrupted EPUB ZIP Header Issue
- Added explicit EPUB format and version specification to pandoc command
- Implemented ZIP structure validation to ensure EPUB files are valid
- Added file integrity checks before sending the response
- Improved file handling to prevent truncation or corruption

### 2. Enhanced File Transfer
- Implemented in-memory file handling to avoid temporary file issues
- Added proper HTTP headers to prevent caching issues
- Added multiple verification steps for file integrity
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for file handling

## Metadata Handling Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Title and Author Handling
- Added robust validation for title and author values
- Created a dedicated metadata file for better control over EPUB metadata
- Added verification step to check if metadata was properly included in the EPUB file
- Added environment variables for additional metadata fields (language, date, rights, publisher)

### 2. Metadata Verification
- Added functionality to verify that title and author are properly set in the EPUB file
- Implemented multiple methods to extract and check metadata from EPUB files
- Added detailed logging of metadata verification results

## Debugging Enhancements for Zero Byte Output Issue

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Configured logging to output to stdout for container logs
- Added detailed log messages at key points in the conversion process

### 2. File Verification
- Added checks to verify file existence and size
- Ensures input and output files are created correctly
- Detects zero byte output files and provides clear error messages

### 3. Pandoc Output Capture
- Captured and logged both stdout and stderr from pandoc
- Helps identify issues with the pandoc conversion process

### 4. Health Check Endpoint
- Added a health check endpoint (`/`) to verify the API is running
- Used by Docker's health check feature

### 5. Debugging Tools
- Added debugging tools to the container (curl, wget, procps, htop)
- Helps diagnose issues inside the container

### 6. Test Script
- Created a test script (`test_api.py`) to test the API
- Provides detailed output about the conversion process
- Helps identify where issues might be occurring

### 7. Setup Script
- Created a setup script (`setup_debug.sh`) to prepare the debugging environment
- Creates necessary directories and sets permissions
- Checks for required dependencies

### 8. Docker Compose Updates
- Updated docker-compose.yml with better logging configuration
- Added volume mounts for test files and outputs
- Configured resource limits and health checks

### 9. Debugging Guide
- Created a comprehensive debugging guide (DEBUG.md)
- Provides step-by-step instructions for diagnosing issues
- Includes common solutions and troubleshooting steps

## Documentation

### 1. Security Documentation
- Created SECURITY.md with detailed security information
- Documents all security measures and provides additional recommendations

### 2. Debugging Documentation
- Created DEBUG.md with comprehensive debugging instructions
- Explains how to use the test script and interpret results

### 3. Changes Documentation
- This document (CHANGES.md) summarizes all changes made

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Updates**: Continue to update dependencies and base images regularly
2. **Security Scanning**: Implement automated security scanning of the Docker image
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for the application to detect issues early
4. **Testing**: Expand test coverage to ensure the application works correctly in various scenarios

These changes significantly improve the security posture of the Docker image and provide comprehensive tools for diagnosing and fixing the zero byte output issue.
