# Streamlining My Knowledge Management Workflow with a Markdown to EPUB Converter

As someone deeply invested in personal knowledge management, I've always struggled with the gap between content discovery and long-form reading. My workflow typically involves discovering interesting articles through my RSS reader, saving valuable insights in Obsidian, and then wanting to read longer pieces on my e-reader. This disconnect led me to create the Markdown to EPUB Converter, a simple yet powerful tool that bridges this gap in my knowledge management system.

## The Problem: From RSS to E-Reader

My knowledge workflow had a missing link:

1. **Discovery**: I use an RSS reader to discover interesting articles and blog posts
2. **Organization**: I save key insights and notes in Obsidian using Markdown
3. **Deep Reading**: For longer content, I prefer my e-reader for a distraction-free experience

The challenge was getting content from Obsidian (in Markdown format) to my e-reader (which works best with EPUB). While there are online converters available, I wanted something I could self-host, customize, and integrate into my existing tools.

## The Solution: A Self-Hosted Markdown to EPUB Converter

I built a simple REST API service that converts Markdown content to EPUB format. The key features include:

- **Simple API**: Send Markdown content and receive a properly formatted EPUB file
- **Web Interface**: A clean UI for manual conversions
- **Optional Authentication**: Secure the API when needed
- **Docker Integration**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over my data and conversion process

## Learning Through Building

This project wasn't just about solving a practical problemâ€”it was also an opportunity to learn:

1. **Self-Hosting Techniques**: I wanted to improve my skills in creating self-hostable applications that integrate well with my existing infrastructure
2. **AI-Supported Coding**: I leveraged AI tools to accelerate development, particularly for boilerplate code and documentation
3. **Deployment with Dokploy**: I used Dokploy as my deployment platform, which simplified the process of getting the service up and running

The AI-supported coding aspect was particularly interesting. By providing clear requirements and context, I was able to use AI to help generate initial code structures, suggest security improvements, and assist with documentation. This allowed me to focus more on the architecture and integration aspects of the project.

## The Result: A Seamless Knowledge Flow

Now my workflow is much more streamlined:

1. Find interesting content in my RSS reader
2. Save and organize it in Obsidian
3. When I want to read longer pieces on my e-reader, I simply convert the Markdown to EPUB using my self-hosted service
4. Read comfortably on my e-reader, with proper formatting and navigation

The service runs on my home server using Dokploy, which makes maintenance and updates simple. The optional authentication feature ensures that only I can access the service while still keeping it convenient for personal use.

## Future Improvements

While the current version serves my needs well, I'm considering a few enhancements:

- Integration with Obsidian through a plugin
- Support for more input formats beyond Markdown
- Batch conversion capabilities
- More customization options for the EPUB output

## Conclusion

Building this Markdown to EPUB Converter has not only streamlined my knowledge management workflow but also provided valuable learning experiences in self-hosting, API design, and AI-assisted development. It's a small but important piece in my personal knowledge management system that helps me bridge the gap between content discovery and deep reading.

If you're interested in trying it out yourself, the project is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/markdown-epub-converter) with comprehensive documentation to get you started.
